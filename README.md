# Theorem Cropper

This utility helps me to automate part of the process of creating learning guides for mathematical topics.

The idea is fairly simple:
1. I make screenshots of the theorems I want to learn
2. I make a rough crop using GIMP
3. **The *theorem cropper* allows me to improve the cropping of all theorem screenshots at once**
4. I'm happy because now I can turn these images into beautiful cards to be learned with Anki :blush: ðŸ¤“
